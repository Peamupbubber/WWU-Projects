WWUMeshes:

This is a program myself and a collaborrator have created for our computer graphics class, which has
the ability to create .obj files for sphere and cylinder meshes out of triangles, which accordingly
have normals and textures mapped onto them. Additionally, it can estminate the normals of a given mesh.
