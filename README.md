# WWU-Projects
All significant projects I have worked on in my time at WWU

I have been working towards computer science degree here at Western Washington University since September of 2020,
and in that time I have taken several computer sceience classes. In those classes I have worked on various labs,
projects, and assingments. Here in this repository I have gathered a collection of the ones I think most
significantly showcase the work I have done, and I will continue to update this repository with new projects as
I continue my education.

One important thing I would like to note: I am currently enrolled in an Object Oriented Design course, which I
do not as of 10/22/2022 have any projects created for, but in the near future there will be relevant-to-the-field
projects that I will upload here as soon as I can.
