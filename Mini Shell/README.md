Mini Shell:

This is a project in which I have developed my own terminal using fork to execute commands while
continuing to accept use input. In additon to this, use input is parsed using my own c program and
there have been 6 commands built in that run using system calls to make them happen rather than
an execute command. The built in functions are exit, pwd, cd, cp, ls, ls -l, and touch. All of this
comes together to create a terminal that is fully interctable, within another terminal
