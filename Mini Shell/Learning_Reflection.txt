CSCI-347 Learning Reflection

Name: Hunter Smith

================================================================
1. What are some of the most important lessons you learned while working on this assignment? Why do you think so?

I really cannot stress how much I learned from this assignment. I knew very little about C, and this assignment has
shown me so many things I didn't understand. I know how malloc works better from this assignment and why it is so
important, I leaned about a ton of useful functions, I understand how structs work in C better, I know more about
how to use fork(), and I spent so much time using the man pages for things that I feel better equipped to learn
things about C and programming in general on my own. This was a really cool project and I had a lot of fun getting
to know C more and learn about all these things.

==========================================================================
2. What do you want to learn more about, and why?

Really I would just like to work more in C going forward. I also want to learn more about fork and multiple
processes, as well as learning more about how to use pointers to my advantage. I just think all these tools we used
in this project are really cool and I would love to continue working with them and learning about them.

==========================================================================
3. What were some of your most challenging/powerful moments and what made them so?

I had quite a few moments where I was stuck and wasn't sure what to do. In some these moments I actually was able to
use our textbook to find relevant examples in order to better understand what tools I had at my disposal. For example,
I was able to understand how to use the stat struct in order to gain information about files.. I know we covered that in
class but I wasn't really sure how to use it at that point. I was also able to get help from classmates, one of which
helped me to understand why malloc was so important for this assignment, and that really felt like a powerful moment.

I also took it upon myself to implement the formatting of ls -l, and maybe I didn't do it in the most efficient way
possible, but I am really proud of being able to get it to look exactly like the the actual ls -l command.

===============================================================================
4. What did you learn were your greatest strengths? Your biggest areas for improvement?

I felt like I was able to reas through most of the problems I encountered, and I felt like I was able to figure out those
problems using the book, man pages, or classmates very effectively. I really tried to communicate with others a lot and
do my best to actually learn and understand the concepts behind this assignment as well as I could. I think areas of
improvement could probably be just coding style. Theres a few places in this code where I think it got a bit cluttered,
and I probably could do a better job of making things a bit more succinct.

===============================================================================
5. Reread the learning objectives (LOs) of the assignment. State them below and rate your confidence about them on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is Not Confident at all, and 5 is Very Confident. 
Example: LO1: Demonstrate how to write clean and readable code in C. (Confidence level: 4)

1) Demonstrate how to implement the fork-exec-wait pattern. (Confidence level: 4)
2) Demonstrate how to dynamically allocate memory and manage it. (Confidence level: 4)
3) Create system utilities using system calls. (Confidence level: 5)
4) Construct a complex C program with high quality (good stlye, robust, efficient). (Confidence level: 4)
5) Inspect code to find defects and suggets solutions. (Confidence level: 3)
6) Evaluate memory management using Valgrind. (Confidence level: 5)
